# midi-solenoid-driver
A set of PCBs to drive solenoids using MIDI data, for use in automating musical instruments.

The boards in this repo will be available for sale shortly on Tindie and/or eBay. If you are interested in buying assembled PCBs or bare PCBs, please send me a message as it would be helpful to know how many might sell. Thanks!
